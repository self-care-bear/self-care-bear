# Description:

Self Care Bear is an app that cares about you and wants you to care for yourself. It exists to help you create your ideal morning routine, stringing habits together in the name of self care.

# API:

The app uses private routes based on an authenticated user, and an API connection with Supabase. Our API (Supabase) data includes user authentication, which uses foreign keys to connect to a second table, user profile. The third table that we use is a ‘created_tasks’ table, which connects to the user profile with the user id. Lots of connections there to make this habit builder!
